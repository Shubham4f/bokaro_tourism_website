            <div class="sec-content">
                <P>This district of Bokaro was created on 1st April, 1991 by taking out Chas and Chandankiyari
                    C.D.Blocks of Dhanbad district and the entire Bermo Subdivision of Giridih district and then merging
                    them to form a new district. Bokaro district is bounded on the east by Dhanbad district and some
                    portion of West Bengal State, on the west by Ramgarh district, on the south by Purulia district of
                    West Bengal and on the north by parts of Giridih, Hazaribag and Dhanbad districts. The district
                    extends between 23o26” to 23o57” North Latitude and 85o34” to 86o26” East Latitude. The district is
                    located at an elevation of 200-546 m. from mean sea level. The Settlement Report for Manbhum, 1928
                    and the District Gazetteer for Dhanbad, 1964 are the sources available to trace some historical
                    background of newly created district of Bokaro. As a matter of fact, not much information is
                    available for Bokaro district exclusively. The District of Dhanbad was created on 24.10.1956 on the
                    recommendation of the State Reconstitution Commission. The then district of Dhanbad consisted of two
                    subdivisions, viz., Dhanbad Sadar & Baghmara. On 01.04.1991 the Baghmara Subdivision, known as Chas
                    Subdivision, became part and parcel of Bokaro district.</P>

                <img src="img/about2.jpg" alt="early bokaro">
                <P>The early history of the greater part of the area is difficult to trace, as the present district of
                    Bokaro forms only a small and insignificant part of Manbhum. In the Settlement Report of Manbhum, It
                    has been stated that no rock inscription, no copper plates or old coins were discovered in course of
                    the survey and settlement operations. The oldest authentic documents produced were all on paper and
                    they are barely a hundred years old. Earlier, district of Bokaro, which till 1991 Census was part of
                    Dhanbad district, was in turn, part of the old district of Manbhum. Manbhum derived its name from
                    Raja Man Singh who got this territory as a gift from Emperor Akbar. Later on the extremely vast and
                    far-flung district of Manbhum, got divided into Birbhum, Manbhum and Singhbhum. The area now forming
                    part of Bokaro district was inhabited primarily by the people of Kolar race. The earliest
                    civilization in the area was that of Jains in around 600 B.C. The Jain domination was superseded by
                    Brahamins around 7th century A.D. as is evident from the travel account of Hiuen Tsang which makes a
                    mention of powerful kingdom ruled by Sasanka who was a persecutor of Buddhists. The Brahamical
                    civilization was at its prime in the 10th century A.D. and was destroyed completely thereafter by
                    the Bhumij and Mundari tribe. During Akbar’s time, Raja Man Singh led his troops from Bhagalpur to
                    Midnapur through Jharkhand area and he might have passed through the areas covered by Bokaro
                    district.</P>

            <div class="sec-heading">British Period</div>
            <div class="sec-content">
                <P>The old district of Manbhum (consisting of the present Bokaro district) was acquired by the British
                    in 1765. During the British period a series of military operation brought the petty Zamindar under
                    control. The permanent settlement was effected in this area in 1796. In 1805 a new district named
                    Jungle Mahal was constituted into a separate magisterial charge with headquarters at Bankura. In
                    1833 the district of Jungle Mahal was broken up and a new district called Manbhum was constituted,
                    later on in 1838 Purulia was fixed as the headquarter of Manbhum district. In fact, Bokaro, the
                    industrial area of prominence gained importance and won the famous place in the map of India with
                    decision of Govt. of India in the early 1960’s to establish modern public Sector Steel Plant with
                    the collaboration of the Soviet Russia. It was in 1966 that Smt. Indira Gandhi, the late Prime
                    Minister laid the foundation stone of what today is famous as Bokaro Steel Plant. Again in early
                    1990’s a new horizon had opened with the identification of enormous source of Methane gas in the
                    Chandankiyari area by the ONGC. It is reported that the ONGC is planning to establish an enormous
                    Gas Plant in the region, which will be greater in size and importance than the present Bokaro Steel
                    Plant.</P>

                <P>District headquarter of Bokaro occupies very important place in industrialization of Jharkhand and
                    country as a whole. During 1965 4th integrated steel plant in the Public Sector with collaboration
                    of Soviet Union was started. At present production of steel in Bokaro steel plant is 4 million tones
                    which is likely to go up to 10 million tones annually. Bokaro is thus stated to be India’s largest
                    Steel manufacturing Complex, Coal for the steel plant is supplied from different Washeries of
                    district i.e. at Dugdha, Kathara, Karagali etc.</P>
